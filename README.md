UBC CS210 2017 (Academic Usage Only) - Java - Term Project "Buses'R'us"

School Term Project

Buses'R'Us is a Java application made for Andriod.
It allows users to check live bus locations based on BC's Transit api, check bus times based on location the user has chosen, and it allows users to see the closest bus stop available for them based on GPS location.
